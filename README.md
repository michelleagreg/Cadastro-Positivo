Large-scale credit data migration with strong governance and BI insights
# ðŸ“Œ Positive Credit Data Migration & Governance Framework

This repository showcases a real-world case of **data migration, governance, and quality validation** developed for Brazilâ€™s **Positive Credit System (Cadastro Positivo)**.  
The project involved moving massive volumes of sensitive financial data from **legacy platforms to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, while implementing a **data quality and governance framework** to ensure accuracy, compliance, and business reliability.
